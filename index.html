    <h2>'ello!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to 69105.xyz, my (Andrew / CDP1802 / BurritoBeans) personal little project tracker and info site made with only the worst HTML. Yes it looks bad, no I probably won't put effort into making it better. I have other domains for that!</p> 
    <p>The structure of this site is simple, just lists of the projects I want to see done. Most of these have been "in the works" for months if not years, all of them are things I tell myself I need to do, and I'd like to see as many of these get done as possible. I'll be adding things on this list until January 3rd, 2021 at 12AM EST. Once that point hits, nothing more can be added. I'm going to do my damndest to make sure that, before I bring any more projects into the house by my own choice, I complete at least <b>FOUR</b> things from among these lists.</p>
    <p>If I can hold to this, which I seriously hope I do, there should be a few benefits. I'll put money towards less random junk and more focused ideas, I should learn more about things, and I'll actually feel a sense of progress with what I enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Projects for 2022</h2>
    <p>Alright, stuff will be listed in the following way:</p>
    <p><b>Project:</b> Description of what needs done. Start date. <i>Updates.</i> <b>End date.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>A Better Workbench:</b> I'm using a cheap 1970s computer desk, it's time to upgrade.</p>
    <p><b>Apple II+:</b> The first computer in my family, now belonging to me, which I would like to futureproof with components like a modern power supply.</p>
    <p><b>Cartridge Translation:</b> A friend gave me some Famicom cartridges to redo save batteries and add translation patches. They need to be done.</p>
    <p><b>Japanese Language Study:</b> I know, this takes more than one year. If I could start to read things like old manuals I would be ecstatic.</p>
    <p><b>Leaf Pile:</b> My idea for a new tabletop role-playing game campaign. Started 1/1/2021. <i>Website, leafpile.info, has been set up to serve as an online rulebook for players. 7/9ths of Character Creation has been added. Need to add all of Character Creation, all starting gear, story, and signups for players.</i></p>
    <p><b>MZ-80C:</b> A beautiful computer which needs some work, I want to repair the tape drive and add a MZ-80KSD.</p>
    <p><b>MZ-80Clone:</b> Creating 1:1 reproduction motherboards of the MZ-80C. Inspired by my own board being in bad shape.</p>
    <p><b>Organize the Collection:</b> I have an impressive set of hardware but a horribly scattered way of keeping it. Consolidating things to two locations, the basement shelf and the bedroom, while keeping things functional would save headaches.</p>
    <p><b>PC-8001:</b> A currently useless computer which I love. Building a multifunction board would be extremely helpful.</p>
    <p><b>PC-8801:</b> The start into something new. Getting the MkII running would be nice, getting some sort of Gotek setup would be nicer, and seeing the Soundboard II run would be the nicest.</p>
    <p><b>PC-9801:</b> A computer line which I want to do more with. Making pc98.tech a functional website would be nice, documenting all of the models I own would be nicer.</p>
    <p><b>PZ-9801CL & PC-9801-16CL:</b> Creating 1:1 reproduction boards of the original PC-9801 & creating a 1:1 reproduction of the PC-9801-16 68000 coprocessor card. A way to learn the system hardware much better than I currently know.</p>
    <p><b>X68000:</b> Something I need to get working reliably. Started 1/1/2021. <i>Original "tetris piece" power supply has been swapped for a PicoPSU equivalent, the computer "works" but the soft power section is broken. The machine never goes to a red light, just turning on to blinking green and the front switch making it solid green. I now own a RaSCSI which I would like to use on this computer, too. Will consider "finished" once these two things are done.</i></p>
    <p><b>Z80 ASM:</b> Learn enough Z80 Assembly that I can create some software, maybe even submit to something like a Game Jam.</p>
