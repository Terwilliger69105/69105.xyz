    <h2>'ello!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to 69105.xyz, my (Andrew / CDP1802 / BurritoBeans) personal little project tracker and info site made with only the worst HTML. Yes it looks bad, no I probably won't put effort into making it better. I have other domains for that!</p> 
    <p>The structure of this site is simple, just lists of the projects I want to see done. Most of these have been "in the works" for months if not years, all of them are things I tell myself I need to do, and I'd like to see as many of these get done as possible. I'll be adding things on this list until January 3rd, 2021 at 12AM EST. Once that point hits, nothing more can be added. I'm going to do my damndest to make sure that, before I bring any more projects into the house by my own choice, I complete at least <b>FOUR</b> things from among these lists.</p>
    <p>If I can hold to this, which I seriously hope I do, there should be a few benefits. I'll put money towards less random junk and more focused ideas, I should learn more about things, and I'll actually feel a sense of progress with what I enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Projects for 2022</h2>
    <p>Alright, stuff will be listed in the following way:</p>
    <p><b>Project:</b> Description of what needs done. Start date. <i>Updates.</i> <b>End date.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Apple II+:</b> The first computer in my family, now belonging to me, which I would like to futureproof with components like a modern power supply.</p>
    <p><b>MZ-80C:</b> A beautiful computer which needs some work, I want to repair the tape drive and add a MZ-80KSD.</p>
    <p><b>MZ-80Clone:</b> An idea to create 1:1 reproduction motherboards of the MZ-80C due to mine being in bad shape.</p>
    <p><b>X68000:</b> Something I need to get working reliably. Started 1/1/2021. <i>Original "tetris piece" power supply has been swapped for a PicoPSU equivalent, the computer "works" but the soft power section is broken. The machine never goes to a red light, just turning on to blinking green and the front switch making it solid green. I now own a RaSCSI which I would like to use on this computer, too. Will consider "finished" once these two things are done.</i>
    <p><b>Z80 ASM:</b> Learn enough Z80 Assembly that I can create some software, maybe even submit to something like a Game Jam.</p>
