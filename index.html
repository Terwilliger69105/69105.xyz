    <p>Welcome to 69105.xyz what used to be a website and is now just a project tracker.</p> 
    <p>Yes this looks like ass, no I probably won't be changing it. You should go to my other sites if you want something interesting to read, this domain is more for things like the Minecraft server or BBS than it is for the website.</p>
