    <h2>'ello!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the 69105.xyz placeholder, a page where everything sucks to look at.</p> 
    <p>Yes I want this to be readable on some old-ass web browser, no I don't really care that it looks like trash. Whenever I have the motivation I'll do some CSS and make it look nice.</p>

    <p><b>Notice:</b> Due to life, that thing that occasionally stinks, everything in here has to be pushed back. My next open weekend is looking to be November 13th, I'm also out of all Discord servers until October 23rd, so things will have to be rescheduled.</p>

    <h3>Minecraft Server</h3> 
    <p>Sadly, at the moment, the Minecraft server is having some issues. Things will be back up when Release 1.18 comes out, based on our Alpha 1.2.6 server that was running, so in a few months! The IP will be the usual <b>mc.69105.xyz</b>, there won't be mods, and there will be a whitelist - contact me to join!
