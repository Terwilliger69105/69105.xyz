    <h2>'ello!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to 69105.xyz, my (Andrew / CDP1802 / BurritoBeans) personal little project tracker and info site made with only the worst HTML. Yes it looks bad, no I probably won't put effort into making it better. I have other domains for that!</p> 
    <p>The structure of this site is simple, just lists of the projects I want to see done. Most of these have been "in the works" for months if not years, all of them are things I tell myself I need to do, and I'd like to see as many of these get done as possible. I'll be adding things on this list until January 3rd, 2021 at 12AM EST. Once that point hits, nothing more can be added. I'm going to do my damndest to make sure that, before I bring any more projects into the house by my own choice, I complete at least <b>FOUR</b> things from among these lists.</p>
    <p>If I can hold to this, which I seriously hope I do, there should be a few benefits. I'll put money towards less random junk and more focused ideas, I should learn more about things, and I'll actually feel a sense of progress with what I enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Projects for 2022 - Language Studies</h2>
    <p>This is a simple one-paragraph thing: I want to dedicate to learning better Japanese. I currently can't do much, reading simple texts at best, and having all the Japanese hardware makes me wish my skills were better. I need to get back to consistent study.</p>

    <h2>Projects for 2022 - Retro Computers & Game Systems</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of hardware, over a dozen consoles and over a dozen computers, and not all of it is in the greatest or most usable state. So, in an effort to fix issues from inconvenient hookups to half-functional devices, I'd like to see myself cross these off by 2023. It would definitely be a better use of cash than buying more half-dead hardware.</p>
    <p><b>Overarching Project - Organization:</b> The collection is a mess, scattered between two rooms and the basement of the house. I want to consolidate everything down to two setups, optimally one focused on consoles in the bedroom and one focused on computers in the basement, and make a better storage method for unused hardware if not just selling some off.
    <p><b>Apple II+:</b> The family computer from 1980, it doesn't deserve to be neglected. I've been lazy with the power supply, putting a new board in would be great, and if I'm being honest it could at least use a modern Slot 0 card.</p>
    <p><b>MZ-80C:</b> One of my bigger imports and something that needs to be treated better. Fixing the cassette mechanism would be great, making some sort of SD loader would be greater.
    <p><b>PC-8801MkII:</b> A project since the day I bought it, the fix has been simple and I just haven't done it. It needs a whole new power supply, I have one on-order as-of the time of writing this, and it needs some way to load software without compromising the "Panda" look.
    <p><b>PS1:</b> I bought a Japanese SCPH-5500 with no games, just one controller and hookups. I feel something like an XStation would be the best route, both saving space and money instead of trying to import discs.</p>
    <p><b>Saturn:</b> In a similar situation to the PS1, I bought a Japanese Saturn but sold my whole old collection off years ago. The controller it came with is in terrible condition, I'd like to clean it up, and some sort of ODE would be awesome.</p>
    <p><b>X68000 Expert:</b> It works but isn't reliable. I'd like this machine to live so recap all boards needs to be done. If I could get my RaSCSI to work that would also be great.</p>

    <h2>Projects for 2022 - Replica Circuit Boards</h2>
    <p>Two of the computers I bought in 2021, one of which is even listed below, have had a bit of a fun impact on me. In my head, since I started diving into these systems months ago, I thought it would be the coolest thing ever to create a set of modern PCBs like the Commodore fans have for the 8-bit and Amiga lines. There's nothing to do but start, right</p>
    <p><b>MZ-80Clone:</b> A 1:1 replica of the Sharp MZ-80C motherboard.</p>
    <p><b>PC-980CL:</b> A much bigger project than the MZ-80Clone, a set featuring a 1:1 motherboard <b>and</b> video board replica.</p>
    <p>Both projects can go farther, the MZ-80Clone getting things like composite out/a modern keyboard/a SD cassette loader and the PC-9801CL being both shrunk down and getting some sort of GDC clone chip that way nothing has to be taken from another old board. Still, as I've said, a 1:1 replica project to start seems the most reasonable.</p>
