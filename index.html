    <p>Welcome to 69105.xyz, my (Andrew / CDP1802 / BurritoBeans) personal little project tracker and info site made with only the worst HTML. Yes it looks bad, no I probably won't put effort into making it better. I have other domains for that!</p>

    <h3>Projects for 2022 - Retro Computers & Game Systems</h3>
    <p>I have a lot of hardware, over a dozen consoles and over a dozen computers, and not all of it is in the greatest or most usable state. So, in an effort to fix issues from inconvenient hookups to half-functional devices, I'd like to see myself cross these off by 2023. It would definitely be a better use of cash than buying more half-dead hardware.</p>
    <p><b>Overarching Project - Organization:</b> The collection is a mess, scattered between two rooms and the basement of the house. I want to consolidate everything down to two setups, optimally one focused on consoles in the bedroom and one focused on computers in the basement, and make a better storage method for unused hardware if not just selling some off.
    <p><b>Apple II+:</b> The family computer from 1980, it doesn't deserve to be neglected. I've been lazy with the power supply, putting a new board in would be great, and if I'm being honest it could at least use a modern Slot 0 card.</p>
    <p><b>PC-8801MkII:</b> A project since the day I bought it, the fix has been simple and I just haven't done it. It needs a whole new power supply, I have one on-order as-of the time of writing this, and it needs some way to load software without compromising the "Panda" look.
    <p><b>PS1:</b> I bought a Japanese SCPH-5500 with no games, just one controller and hookups. I feel something like an XStation would be the best route, both saving space and money instead of trying to import discs.</p>
    <p><b>Saturn:</b> In a similar situation to the PS1, I bought a Japanese Saturn but sold my whole old collection off years ago. The controller it came with is in terrible condition, I'd like to clean it up, and some sort of ODE would be awesome.</p>
    <p><b>X68000 Expert:</b> It works but isn't reliable. I'd like this machine to live so recap all boards needs to be done. If I could get my RaSCSI to work that would also be great.</p>
