    <h2>'ello!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to 69105.xyz, my (Andrew / CDP1802 / BurritoBeans) personal little project tracker and info site made with only the worst HTML. Yes it looks bad, no I probably won't put effort into making it better. I have other domains for that!</p> 
    <p>The structure of this site is simple, just lists of the projects I want to see done. Most of these have been "in the works" for months if not years, all of them are things I tell myself I need to do, and I'd like to see as many of these get done as possible. I'll be adding things on this list until January 3rd, 2021 at 12AM EST. Once that point hits, nothing more can be added. I'm going to do my damndest to make sure that, before I bring any more projects into the house by my own choice, I complete at least <b>FOUR</b> things from among these lists.</p>
    <p>If I can hold to this, which I seriously hope I do, there should be a few benefits. I'll put money towards less random junk and more focused ideas, I should learn more about things, and I'll actually feel a sense of progress with what I enjoy.</p>
