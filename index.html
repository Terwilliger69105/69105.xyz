    <p>Welcome to the 69105.xyz placeholder, a page where everything sucks to look at.</p> 
    <p>Yes I want this to be readable on some old-ass web browser, no I don't really care that it looks like trash. Whenever I have the motivation I'll do some CSS and make it look nice.</p>

    <p>No, not at the moment. Things took a huge crash moving from Beta 1.7.9 to Release 1.17, there was also barely any playtime on said Beta 1.7.9 "era" of the server, so the Alpha world will just be converted "straight" to Release 1.18 once that launches. IP will be, as-usual, mc.69105.xyz
